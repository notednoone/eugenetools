        <p>During their journey through the Daggerfrost Mountains, the party was ambushed by Frostclaws. They managed to fight them off, but one fellow Ashen Blade member died, and another was injured. Toby used his medical skills to heal the wounded member's sickness from a Frostclaw's bite, while Oz employed healing magic to mend his leg.</p>
        
        <p>Seeking refuge, they arrived at The Last Stop, a tavern owned by Oram. Toby introduced the group and explained that the Ashen Blade had sent them north to seek adventure and treasure.</p>
        
        <p>Danner attempted to converse with an old man at the bar who ignored him. He left a Frostclaw pelt with Oram to have it tanned by Gavin, agreeing to bring back Ybara plants from the northwestern shore in exchange.</p>
        
        <p>The group headed west along Lake Mistveil in search of the Ybara plant and encountered Sinara, an older woman who is a gardener. She invited them into her home, offering food and drink, and accompanied them to help find the Ybara plants.</p>
        
        <p>Upon returning to The Last Stop, Oram informed them that Gavin was not at home but had been left a note regarding the pelt. The next day, at Oram's request, the party ventured north to search for missing hunters. After setting up camp just outside the village, they traveled further and were attacked by Mud Men. They defeated the creatures and captured one, attempting to communicate with it but without success. Choosing to release it, the creature glanced back at them before disappearing.</p>
        
        <p>Continuing north the following day, they discovered the hunters' camp and found that both men had been killed, seemingly by Mud Men. Gathering the hunters' belongings, they returned to inform Oram of the unfortunate news.</p>
